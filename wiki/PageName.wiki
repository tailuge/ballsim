= Introduction =

Library to compute outcomes on a billiard table

= Details =

  * Rolling physics
  * Sliding physics (e.g. backspin, masse)
  * Cushion collisions (quadratics)
  * Ball-Ball collisions (quartics)
  * Sidespin at cushions
  * Expand events for multiple balls
  * Searching for good outcomes
